Each challenge sets itself up with the "setup" shell script. In this case,the pig and wukong challenges
simply create their output directories.

The run shell script runs the challenge. At the moment, there is no way to monitor the timing. The run 
script in the main directroy also does some validity checking a at the end to make sure that the output
generated by pig and by wukong are equivalent.

Finally, to tear down the challenge, you can run the teardown script. It will delete the pig and wukong 
results.
