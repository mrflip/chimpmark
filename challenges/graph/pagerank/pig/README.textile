h1. Pagerank

The scripts here can be used to run the pagerank algorithm on any general set of adjaceny pairs
with little to no modifications.

h2. Step one

Initialize the graph for iteration from an input set of adjacency pairs.

<pre><code>
pig -param ADJLIST=/path/to/adjacency_list -param INITGRPH=/path/to/output_graph pagerank_initialize.pig
</code></pre>

h2. Step two

Run the algorithm for some number of iterations. For now no convergence checking is done.
You'll need to pass in the number of iterations as well as the directory where you dumped
the initial graph.

<pre><code>
./iterate_pagerank num_iterations /path/to/output_of_pagerank_initialize.pig
</code></pre>

h2. Step three

Be happy.
