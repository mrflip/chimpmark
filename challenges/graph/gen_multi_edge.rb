# Takes any number of flavors of directed edge with the form
#
#   a_relatesto_b src_id dest_id [optional fields]
#
# and prepares a combined adjacency list.  You need to supply a model named
# "MultiEdge" with members for each edge type.
#
# For instance, suppose you have a social network with edges like
#
#   a_follows_b   user_a_id  user_b_id
#   a_messages_b  user_a_id  user_b_id  message_id date
#   a_favorites_b user_a_id  user_b_id  message_id date
#
# Your MultiEdge class might look like
#
#   class MultiEdge < Struct(
#     :src, :dest,
#     :a_follows_b,   :b_follows_a,
#     :a_messages_b,   :b_messages_a,
#     :a_favorites_b, :b_favorites_a
#     )
#   end
#
# The row for a user pair who follows each other; with user_a #24601 messaging b
# 57 times and favoriting 5 of user_b's messages; and user_b #8675309 messaging
# 62 times and favoriting none, will emerge as (tab separated, with [blank]
# indicating there is no text in that slot):
