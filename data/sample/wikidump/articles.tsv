A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and [[syndicalism]] (or [[trade union]]ism). Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a [[social revolution]], while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-besnard.org/article.php3?id_article=225 Extract of Malatesta's declaration] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that the trade-union movement was [[reformism|reformist]] and even [[Conservatism|conservative]], citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials.

The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book&#10; |last=Beevor&#10; |first=Antony&#10; |authorlink=Antony Beevor&#10; |year=2006&#10; |title=The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939&#10; |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson&#10; |location=London&#10; |isbn=978-0297-848325&#10; |page=24&#10; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] (CGT) and the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]. CGT membership was estimated to be around 100,000 for the year 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Carley, Mark &quot;Trade union membership 1993–2003&quot; (International:SPIRE Associates 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]] and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]]. The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]], claiming 2,000 paying members, and the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the First International, also remain active.&#10;&#10;=== Propaganda of the deed ===&#10;{{Main|Propaganda of the deed}}&#10;[[Image:German anti-communist poster 1918.jpg|right|thumb|Propaganda poster depicting an angel protecting against a bomb-throwing, knife-wielding [[Bolshevik]] activist: propaganda of the deed was widely viewed negatively]]&#10;Some anarchists, such as [[Johann Most]], advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because &quot;we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bright/most/actionprop.html &quot;Action as Propaganda&quot; by Johann Most, July 25, 1885]&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1880s, the slogan &quot;propaganda of the deed&quot; had begun to be used both within and outside of the anarchist movement to refer to individual bombings, [[regicide]]s and [[tyrannicide]]s. However, as soon as 1887, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts. [[Peter Kropotkin]] thus wrote that year in ''Le Révolté'' that &quot;a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Billington, James H. 1998. ''Fire in the minds of men: origins of the revolutionary faith'' New Jersey: Transaction Books, p 417.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favor of collective revolutionary action, for example through the [[trade union]] movement. The [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]], [[Fernand Pelloutier]], argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labor movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without &quot;the individual dynamiter.&quot;[http://blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm]&#10;&#10;[[Political repression|State repression]] (including the infamous 1894 French ''[[lois scélérates]]'') of the anarchist and [[labor movement]]s following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French [[socialist movement]], into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], the execution and exile of many ''[[communards]]'' to [[penal colonies]], favored individualist political expression and acts.&lt;ref&gt;Historian [[Benedict Anderson]] thus writes: &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;small&gt; &quot;In March 1871 the Commune took power in the abandoned city and held it for two months. Then [[Adolphe Thiers|Versailles]] seized the moment to attack and, in one horrifying week, executed roughly 20,000 Communards or suspected sympathizers, a number higher than those killed in the recent war or during [[Robespierre]]’s ‘[[Reign of Terror|Terror]]’ of 1793–94. More than 7,500 were jailed or deported to places like New Caledonia. Thousands of others fled to Belgium, England, Italy, Spain and the United States. In 1872, stringent laws were passed that ruled out all possibilities of organizing on the left. Not till 1880 was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned Communards. Meanwhile, the Third Republic found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon]]’s imperialist expansion– in Indochina, Africa, and Oceania. Many of France’s leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the Commune ([[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] was its quasi-minister of culture, [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and [[Pissarro]] were active propagandists) or were sympathetic to it. The ferocious repression of 1871 and thereafter, was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the Third Republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad.&quot; (in {{cite news |author=Benedict Anderson |title=In the World-Shadow of Bismarck and Nobel |publisher=[[New Left Review]]|date=July -August 2004|url=http://newleftreview.org/?view=2519}}) &lt;/small&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; According to some analysts, in [[History of Germany since 1945|post-war Germany]], the prohibition of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] (KDP) and thus of institutional far-left political organization may also, in the same manner, have played a role in the creation of the [[Red Army Faction]].&lt;/ref&gt;&#10;&#10;Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement.  For example, U.S. [[William McKinley|President McKinley's]] assassin [[Leon Czolgosz]] claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and [[feminist]] [[Emma Goldman]]. This was in spite of Goldman's disavowal of any association with him, his registered membership in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and never having belonged to an anarchist organization. Bombings were associated in the media with anarchists because [[international terrorism]] arose during this time period with the widespread distribution of dynamite. This image remains to this day.&#10;&#10;Propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after [[World War I]] (1914–18) and the [[October Revolution|1917 October Revolution]]. Important factors towards this include state repression, the level of organization of the labour movement, and the influence of the [[October Revolution]]{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}.&#10;&#10;===Russian Revolution===&#10;{{main|Anarchism in Russia|Russian Revolution (1917)}}&#10;[[Image:Goldmanberkman.jpeg|thumb|right|Anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] opposed [[Bolshevik]] consolidation of power following the [[Russian Revolution (1917)]].]]&#10;Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolshevik]]s in both [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution|October revolutions]], and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dirlik | first = Arif | title = Anarchism in the Chinese Revolution | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1991 | isbn = 0520072979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict that culminated in the 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion]] which the new government repressed.

[[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchists]] played a key role in the [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organisation ''[[Arditi del Popolo]]'', which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions, and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling [[Blackshirts]] in the anarchist stronghold of [[Parma]] in August 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Holbrow, Marnie, [http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=8205 &quot;Daring but Divided&quot;] (''Socialist Review'' November 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; In France, where the [[far right leagues]] came close to insurrection in the [[6 February 1934 crisis|February 1934 riots]], anarchists divided over a [[united front]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, David. &quot;Fascism or Revolution.&quot; ''Le Libertaire''.

Anarchist attitudes towards [[Issues in anarchism#Race|race]], [[Issues in anarchism#Gender|gender]] and [[Issues in anarchism#The environment|the environment]] have changed significantly since the modern origin of the philosophy in the 18th century.{{cite}}&#10;&#10;On a tactical level, while [[propaganda of the deed]] was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the [[Nihilist movement]]), contemporary anarchists espouse alternative [[direct action]] methods such as [[nonviolence]], [[counter-economics]] and [[Crypto-anarchism|anti-state cryptography]] to bring about an anarchist society. About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a [[global]] one, while others do so by local ones.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Honderich, Carmen García Trevijano, [http://books.google.es/books?id=s9iwZGv44psC&amp;pg=PA402&amp;dq=Enciclopedia+teor%C3%ADa+pol%C3%ADtica&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA57,M1 ''Oxford Enciclopedy of Philosophy''].&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many [[Issues in anarchism#Definitional concerns|definitional concerns in anarchist theory]].&#10;&#10;==Related pages==&#10;{{Portal box|Anarchism|Philosophy|Politics|Social and political philosophy|Sociology}}&#10;{{main|Outline of anarchism}}&#10;*[[Anarchist symbolism]]&#10;*[[Lists of anarchism topics]]&#10;*[[List of anarchist communities]]&#10;*[[List of anarchist movements by region]]&#10;{{-}}&lt;!-- Please use this section for major overview articles/lists that address a significant aspect of anarchism  --&gt;&#10;&#10;==Footnotes==&#10;{{Reflist|3}}&#10;&#10;==Further reading==&#10;* ''[[Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas]].''

Established in 1979, BRI produced the first-ever English translation of all of the works of Rebbe [[Nachman of Breslov]] (1772-1810) and selected works of [[Nathan of Breslov|Reb Noson]] (1780-1844), the Rebbe's closest disciple; studies of the Rebbe's key teachings on many subjects; contemporary Breslov [[biography|biographies]]; and [[self-help book]]s for applying the Rebbe's wisdom to daily life.&lt;ref name=&quot;BRI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breslov.org/aboutbri/breslovresearch.html |title=What is the Breslov Research Institute? |first= |year=2009 |accessdate=2010-04-17 |publisher=breslov.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;. It currently has over 100 titles in print,&lt;ref name=&quot;BRI&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; many of which it has also translated into [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[French language|French]]. BRI maintains offices in [[Jerusalem]] and [[New York]].&#10;&#10;==History==&#10;The founding of Breslov Research Institute was an outgrowth of the [[Orthodox Judaism outreach|outreach]] work of Rabbi [[Zvi Aryeh Rosenfeld]], who brought the teachings of Rebbe Nachman to American shores beginning in the late 1940s. While Rabbi Rosenfeld primarily taught students in the New York area and disseminated his lectures on tape, he encouraged one of his students, Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]], to produce an English translation of a key Breslov text, ''Shevachey V'Sichot HaRan'' (''Rabbi Nachman's Wisdom''), in 1973, which Rabbi Rosenfeld edited. In 1979, one year after Rabbi Rosenfeld's death, his son-in-law, Chaim Kramer, established the Breslov Research Institute to continue the effort to publish Breslov teachings in English.&#10;&#10;===1980s===&#10;In the 1980s, BRI produced the first-ever English translations of many key Breslov texts, including:&#10;*''Rabbi Nachman's Stories'' (translation and commentary of ''Sippurey Ma'asiyot'', Rebbe Nachman's [[parable]]s and stories)&#10;*''Rabbi Nachman's Tikkun'' (on the ''[[Tikkun HaKlali]]'')&#10;*''Tzaddik'' (translation of ''Chayey Moharan'')&#10;*''Advice'' (translation of ''Likutey Eitzot'')&#10;*''The Aleph-Bet Book'' (translation of ''Sefer HaMiddot'')&#10;&#10;BRI also published ''Until the Mashiach'', an annotated chronology of the life of Rebbe Nachman, and ''Crossing the Narrow Bridge'', an original work which spelled out the key concepts of Breslov Hasidut in a down-to-earth manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Narrow-Bridge-Chaim-Kramer/dp/0930213408 |title=Crossing the Narrow Bridge (Hardcover) |last= |first= |year=1996-2010 |accessdate=2010-04-17 |publisher=amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&#10;&#10;Beginning in 1984, BRI undertook the translation, annotation and commentary of Rebbe Nachman's main work, ''Likutey Moharan''. As of 2010, the series stands at 13 published volumes. The complete series is projected as 15 volumes, plus an index volume.&lt;ref&gt;''Breslov Pirkey Avot'' (2010). Jerusalem/New York: Breslov Research Institute. Bibliography, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;&#10;&#10;===1990s===&#10;During the 1990s, BRI produced a definitive biography of Reb Noson, the Rebbe's closest disciple (''Through Fire and Water''), and translated Reb Noson's prolific letters in a 4-volume set (''Eternally Yours'').&#10;&#10;===2000s===&#10;In the 2000s, BRI continued to achieve publishing milestones with the first-ever English translation of the ''Kitzur Likutey Moharan'' (''Abridged Likutey Moharan'') and the first compilation of Breslov teachings on [[Pirkei Avot]].&#10;&#10;To date, BRI has published all the writings of Rebbe Nachman and selected writings of Reb Noson. It has also published original works by contemporary Breslov authors presenting Rebbe Nachman's teachings on prayer, [[hitbodedut]], [[tefillin]], [[Shabbat]], [[Jewish holiday]]s, [[Jewish messianism|Mashiach]], the [[Land of Israel]], the ''[[Sephirot|Sefirot]],'' and [[Uman]] (burial place of Rebbe Nachman). BRI has also published a series of illustrated [[Children's literature|children's books]] based on Rebbe Nachman's parables.&#10;&#10;Additionally, BRI has produced a number of audio recordings of traditional Breslov songs and melodies, plus two books of Breslov [[sheet music]].&#10;&#10;==References==&#10;{{reflist}}&#10;&#10;==External links==&#10;*[http://www.breslov.org/ Breslov Research Institute home page]&#10;&#10;{{DEFAULTSORT:Breslov Research Institute}}&#10;[[Category:Book publishing companies of Israel]]&#10;[[Category:Jewish printing and publishing]]&#10;[[Category:Music publishing companies]]&#10;[[Category:Breslov Hasidism]]&#10;[[Category:1979 establishments]]</text>&#10;    </revision>&#10;  </page>
